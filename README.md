# AustralianFoodborneIllnessCosting
 
Repository of R code and data for costing the burden of food-borne illness in Australia circa 2018.

Estimates burden (cases, hospitalisations, and deaths) due to foodborne disease and 10 priority pathogens and four sequel illnesses, estimates associated costs (direct medical costs, lost productivity, pain and suffering, and fatality). Estiamtes are outputted as .csv files, but can also be explored in an interactive shiny app. The app also allows users to estimate costs for foodborne disease outbreaks based on estimated number of cases, hospitalisations, and deaths using the same costing framework for the main estimates.

Web-hosted version of interactive table can be found at https://angusmclure.shinyapps.io/AusFBDCosting/

The development of this code was commissioned by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ), conducted by Angus McLure at the Australian National University.

This code was used to calculate the estimates presented in the [FSANZ report]( https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/publications/Documents/ANU%20Foodborne%20Disease%20Final%20Report.pdf) *The annual cost of foodborne disease in Australia* (published 2022).
